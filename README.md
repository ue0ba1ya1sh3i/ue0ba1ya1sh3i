### JSON / Data
- #### Record unorganized data first

### Code
  - #### Use line breaks where necessary
  - #### Use camelCase as the default for naming definitions such as variable definitions

### Comments
- #### Add comments for complex logic or parts that are easy to forget
- #### Don't put it where it shouldn't
- #### Explain by logical sections

### Code Organization Flow
#### 1. Start by grouping definitions and settings
#### 2. Write the main logic in order from top to bottom
#### 3. Place temporary or experimental code at the top, then refactor
